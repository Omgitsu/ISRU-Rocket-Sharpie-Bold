# ISRU Rocket Sharpie Bold

**"Inspired" by Tom Sachs' handwriting**

A dynamic display font useful for ISRU summercamp and beyond, featuring contextual alternates that bring the organic variability of Tom's Sharpie to digital typography.

**Created by @omgitsu**  
**S/N: 2025.063.27251**

## Features

### Contextual Alternates (calt)
The font includes intelligent contextual alternates that automatically vary letter forms to simulate natural handwriting:

- **Lowercase letters [a-z]**: Pseudorandomly alternate between lowercase, capital, stylistic set 01, and stylistic set 02
- **Numbers [0-9]**: Pseudorandomly alternate between base form and stylistic sets 01, 02, and 03

This creates natural-looking text variation without manual intervention.

### Standard Ligatures
![LIGATURES](documentation/img/2x/ICONS@2x.png)
Special ligature sequences automatically replace standard glyphs:

- `[ISRU]`
- `[NIKECRAFT]`
- `[NIKELOGO]`
- `[OUTANDBACK]`
- `[OBI]`
- `[TEN]`
- `[WALL]`
- `[READ]`


### Bullet Points
![TEN BULLETS](documentation/img/2x/ten-bullets@2x.png)
The font includes 10 bullet points (â€¢) because of course there are.
- **macOS**: Option + 8
- **Windows**: Alt + 0149 (using numeric keypad)

### Stylistic Sets
- **Stylistic Set 01 & 02**: Alternate glyphs for visual variety
- **Stylistic Set 03**: Repeat of capital glyphs (used for programming the calt feature)

## Character Set

All glyphs are based on scans of Tom Sachs' works. Some characters are "franken-glyphs" or best guesses where original references weren't available:

**Currencies**: $, â‚¬, Â£, Â¥  
**Fractions**: Â½, Â¼, Â¾  
**Punctuation**: Â¿, Â¡, ~, â€½, â„¢, Â©, Â®

## Development

## Usage Examples

### CSS Implementation
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'ISRU Rocket Sharpie Bold';
  src: url('path/to/ISRURocketSharpieBold.woff2') format('woff2'));

  font-style: normal;
}

.handwritten {
  font-family: 'ISRU Rocket Sharpie Bold', sans-serif;

```

### HTML Demo
```html
<div class="handwritten">
  <h1>Welcome to [ISRU] Summer Camp</h1>
  <p>This is how the contextual alternates work - notice how each letter 
     varies naturally as you type, creating authentic handwritten appeal.</p>
  <p>Numbers also vary: 1234567890 vs 1234567890</p>
  <p>Special ligatures: [NIKECRAFT] [WALL] [READ] [TEN]</p>
</div>
```

### Stylistic Set Usage

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, especially if you have scans of the franken-glyphs mentioned above. Help us improve the authenticity of the currency symbols, fractions, and uncommon punctuation marks.

## Sources

The font has been created with FontLab 8.  A Glyphs export is also provided - but it is untested because I don't have Glyphs. 


### Building the `calt` from source

1. Open the source files in the `/scripts` directory
2. Run the Node.js compilation script:
   ```bash
   node compiler.js > calt.fea
   ```

## Inspiration

This font pays homage to Tom Sachs' distinctive Sharpie style, for artistic purposes, and for various Summer Camp challenges. Perfect for projects that need an authentic, handcrafted aesthetic - I guess.
