# ISRU Rocket Sharpie Bold

**"Inspired" by Tom Sachs' handwriting**

A dynamic display font useful for ISRU summercamp and beyond, featuring contextual alternates that bring the organic variability of handwritten text to digital typography.

**Created by @omgitsu**  
**S/N: 2025.063.27251**

## Features

### Contextual Alternates (calt)
The font includes intelligent contextual alternates that automatically vary letter forms to simulate natural handwriting:

- **Lowercase letters [a-z]**: Pseudorandomly alternate between lowercase, capital, stylistic set 01, and stylistic set 02
- **Numbers [0-9]**: Pseudorandomly alternate between base form and stylistic sets 01, 02, and 03

This creates natural-looking text variation without manual intervention.

### Standard Ligatures
Special ligature sequences automatically replace standard glyphs:

- `[ISRU]`
- `[NIKECRAFT]`
- `[NIKELOGO]`
- `[OUTANDBACK]`
- `[OBI]`
- `[TEN]`
- `[WALL]`
- `[READ]`

### Bullet Points
The font includes 10 bullet points (â€¢) because of course there are.
- **macOS**: Option + 8
- **Windows**: Alt + 0149 (using numeric keypad)

### Stylistic Sets
- **Stylistic Set 01 & 02**: Alternate glyphs for visual variety
- **Stylistic Set 03**: Repeat of capital glyphs (used for programming the calt feature)

## Character Set

All glyphs are based on scans of Tom Sachs' works. Some characters are "franken-glyphs" or best guesses where original references weren't available:

**Currencies**: $, â‚¬, Â£, Â¥  
**Fractions**: Â½, Â¼, Â¾  
**Punctuation**: Â¿, Â¡, ~, â€½, â„¢, Â©, Â®

## Development

## Usage Examples

### CSS Implementation
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'ISRU Rocket Sharpie Bold';
